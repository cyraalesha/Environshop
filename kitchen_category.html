                              At Our Place, we believe sharing a home-cooked meal is foundational to connection. We make products that connect people over home-cooking. Our collections are new heirlooms from the cultures and places that make up the fabric of the modern kitchen. We believe that there is a transformative power in uplifting the differences in how people cook and eat together. We invest in ethical factories that provide supportive environments and compensation to their teams so that the people who make our products have time, energy, and resources to connect with the people they love.

It is a major problem. Rather than just give up and “deal with it”, Strawesome was born to do something about it. Since March 2009, we have been working towards sufficient awareness and action to forever eliminate the need for single-use plastic drinking straws.

                            <p>
                              Created in 2013 by Sally Erickson, Vejibag was born out of necessity.  She needed to keep veggies as fresh as possible from the time they were picked in her year-round, Eastport, Maine greenhouse until they were taken home by customers from the local co-op market. And she wanted to do that without creating plastic waste or using toxic chemicals. After some research Sally discovered what produce managers in grocery stores have known for a long time. Moisture-loving vegetables keep best in a cool damp environment. And she discovered that our grandmothers wrapped vegetables in moistened tea towels or burlap to keep them crisp and delicious. She combined those two ideas into  a handy organic cotton bag, was able to eliminate the plastic and come up with a beautiful result: the Vejibag.
